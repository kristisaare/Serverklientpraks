  <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study">Trinity Study</a> </h1>
  <p> In finance, investment advising, and retirement planning, the <strong>Trinity study</strong> is an informal name used to refer to an influential 1998 paper by three professors of finance at Trinity University. It is one of a category of studies that attempt to determine "safe withdrawal rates" from retirement portfolios that contain stocks and thus grow (or shrink) irregularly over time.</p>
  <p> Its conclusions are often encapsulated in a "4% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement_spend-down#Withdrawal_rate">safe withdrawal rate</a> rule-of-thumb," which had previously been published in Bengen (1994), based on the same data and similar analysis. The rule refers to one of the scenarios examined by the authors. The context is one of annual withdrawals from a retirement portfolio containing a mix of stocks and bonds.</p>
  <p> The 4% refers to the portion of the portfolio withdrawn during the first year; it is assumed that the portion withdrawn in subsequent years will increase with the consumer price index (<i>CPI</i>) to keep pace with the cost of living. The withdrawals may exceed the income earned by the portfolio, and the total value of the portfolio may well shrink during periods when the stock market performs poorly. It is assumed that the portfolio needs to last <strong>thirty years</strong>. The withdrawal regime is deemed to have failed if the portfolio is exhausted in less than thirty years and to have succeeded if there are unspent assets at the end of the period.</p>

  <h3> Withdrawal rate </h3>
  <p>A portion of retirement income often comes from savings; colloquially, "tapping into the Nest Egg". These present a number of variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how savings are invested (e.g., cash, stocks, bonds, real estate), and how this changes over time</li>
      <li>inflation during retirement</li>
      <li>how quickly savings are spent â€“ the withdrawal rate</li>
    </ul>
